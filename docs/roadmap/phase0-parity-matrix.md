# Phase 0 API-CLI-WebUI Parity Matrix (v0.1)

Purpose: track contract parity for Helling-owned API domains.

Gate rule: Phase 0 is not complete unless every implemented `/api/v1/*` operation has both CLI and WebUI support (or an explicit docs-approved exception).

Normative inputs:

- API contract: `api/openapi.yaml`
- CLI contract: `docs/spec/cli.md`
- WebUI contract: `docs/spec/webui-spec.md`

Last reviewed against OpenAPI baseline: commit `201a2c7` (2026-04-20). Matrix refreshed 2026-04-20 after CLI-parity restoration (commit `36b1bff`) added `helling user get/update`, `helling audit query/export`, `helling events tail`, `helling system health`, and `helling system upgrade --rollback`.

## Status Notes

All domains have spec-level parity as of 2026-04-20. The matrix currently shows **zero** Phase 0 parity gaps at the spec level. BMC and Notifications domains are tracked separately in `phase0-parity-exceptions.yaml` with target versions v0.4.0 and v0.3.0 respectively — those are explicit scope deferrals, not gaps.

## Exception Policy

Allowed only when all are true:

- Exception is documented in `phase0-parity-exceptions.yaml` with operation_id, `missing` surface, rationale, and target version.
- Exception has an owner and closure criteria.
- Exception target version is a real planned release (v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v0.6.0).

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Every `/api/v1/*` operation mapped to CLI command or approved exception
- [ ] Every `/api/v1/*` operation mapped to WebUI page/action or approved exception
- [ ] Matrix updated when OpenAPI changes
- [ ] Matrix reviewed before Phase 0 completion gate
